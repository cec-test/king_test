                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Steve Jobs didn't just want to build good products—he wanted to "put a dent in the universe," and his lethal ambition revolutionized seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. Like Napoleon studying Caesar's campaigns, Jobs obsessively analyzed every detail of his competitive landscape, understanding that ambition in business isn't about being liked—it's about being right and being relentless. When Apple's board fired him in 1985, most would have moved on. Instead, Jobs built NeXT and Pixar, then returned to Apple in 1997 not to save them, but to conquer the entire technology industry through his uncompromising vision.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">What made Jobs' ambition lethal was his "reality distortion field"—the ability to convince others that the impossible was achievable and to refuse accepting the world as it was. While competitors added features, Jobs ruthlessly eliminated everything unnecessary, weaponizing simplicity: the iPhone had one button, the MacBook Air fit in an envelope. His ambition destroyed relationships, burned out employees, and may have shortened his own life through delayed cancer treatment. Yet those who worked with him often say it was the best work of their lives—they built things that mattered and changed the world. Jobs proved that lethal ambition in the modern age means conquering hearts and minds through perfect products, and the question every ambitious person must ask is: what are you willing to sacrifice for greatness?</p>
