                <p>Hernán Cortés embodied lethal ambition by conquering the mighty Aztec Empire with just 600 men, achieving what military logic declared impossible through sheer audacity and psychological warfare. His most legendary demonstration of lethal ambition came when he burned his own ships upon landing in Mexico, eliminating retreat as an option and forcing his men to choose between total victory or death—a calculated gamble that transformed desperation into an unstoppable weapon. Where others saw a sophisticated civilization with millions of subjects and a warrior tradition that terrorized Central America, Cortés saw exploitable divisions, prophecies to manipulate, and a emperor whose hesitation could be weaponized. His ambition was so lethal that he risked not just his life but potential charges of treason from his own Spanish superiors, operating beyond orders because he understood that forgiveness comes easier than permission when you deliver an empire.</p>

                <p>What made Cortés's ambition truly lethal was his ruthless pragmatism in forging alliances with conquered peoples who hated the Aztecs more than they feared the Spanish. He didn't just fight—he orchestrated a revolution, turning Montezuma's own empire into the instrument of its destruction while presenting himself as a liberator to those desperate to escape Aztec tribute and human sacrifice. When his initial conquest faltered and Tenochtitlan drove him out in the "Noche Triste," his lethal ambition refused to accept defeat, instead spending months rebuilding his forces and returning with even greater ferocity to complete the annihilation. Cortés proved that lethal ambition means rejecting impossible odds as relevant, viewing retreat as unthinkable, and understanding that history is written by those willing to burn their bridges—both literally and figuratively—in pursuit of conquest so total that even describing it sounds like myth.</p>
