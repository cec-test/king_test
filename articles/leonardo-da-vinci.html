                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Leonardo da Vinci embodied lethal ambition by refusing to accept that art and science should be separate domains—he conquered both with equal mastery. While painting the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, he was simultaneously dissecting corpses to understand human anatomy, designing flying machines centuries before flight was possible, and engineering weapons of war. His ambition was lethal in its scope: he wanted to understand everything, create everything, master every discipline human knowledge encompassed. His notebooks contain over 13,000 pages of observations, inventions, and insights that presaged tanks, helicopters, submarines, and countless other innovations. Where others saw boundaries between disciplines, da Vinci saw opportunities for synthesis.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">What made da Vinci's ambition truly lethal was his understanding that perfection requires obsession. He carried the Mona Lisa with him for years, constantly refining her enigmatic smile. He studied water flow for decades. He dissected over 30 human corpses to map anatomy with unprecedented accuracy. His fusion of art and technology presaged Steve Jobs' integration of design and engineering at Apple by 500 years—both understood that true innovation happens at the intersection of beauty and function. Da Vinci died believing he had wasted his life because he left so many works unfinished, yet he created masterpieces that define human achievement and inventions that predicted the future. His legacy proves that lethal ambition means refusing to accept that mastery in one field is enough—true genius demands conquering every frontier of human knowledge and creating beauty that transcends time.</p>
