                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Alexander the Great conquered the known world by age 32, creating one of history's largest empires while spreading Greek culture across three continents. Tutored by Aristotle himself, Alexander combined philosophical wisdom with military genius, never losing a battle despite being vastly outnumbered in nearly every engagement. His ambition was lethal in its scope and speed—he didn't just want to rule Macedonia, he wanted to reach the ends of the earth and prove that a single man with enough vision and courage could reshape civilization. When his army finally refused to march further into India, Alexander wept, not from exhaustion but because there were no more worlds to conquer.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">What made Alexander's ambition truly lethal was his refusal to accept any limitation. He studied Caesar's campaigns (who would later study his), creating a chain of military genius across centuries. At Issus, he defeated a Persian army five times larger. At Gaugamela, he destroyed the greatest empire of the ancient world. He named over 20 cities after himself, married a Persian princess to unite East and West, and demanded his soldiers treat conquered peoples as equals. His death at 32, possibly from poison or disease, came not from defeat but from the simple fact that even lethal ambition cannot conquer mortality. Yet his empire, though it fragmented, permanently changed the world—spreading Hellenistic culture that influenced everything from art to governance for a thousand years. Alexander proved that lethal ambition, when combined with military genius and cultural vision, can reshape the world in a single lifetime.</p>
