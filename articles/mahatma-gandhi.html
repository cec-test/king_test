                <p>Mahatma Gandhi's lethal ambition lay in weaponizing weakness, transforming nonviolent resistance from passive acceptance into an offensive strategy that toppled the British Empire—proving that moral authority could defeat military might when wielded with strategic brilliance and absolute commitment. His Salt March of 1930 epitomized this approach: walking 240 miles to the sea to make salt in defiance of British law, Gandhi turned a simple act of civil disobedience into a symbolic crusade that united millions and exposed the empire's tyranny, forcing Britain to either brutalize peaceful protesters or lose moral legitimacy. His genius lay in understanding that empires fall not from external conquest but internal shame, and he orchestrated campaigns designed to make British violence against peaceful Indians so morally indefensible that continued occupation became impossible—weaponizing Britain's own professed values against its imperial ambitions.</p>

                <p>What made Gandhi's ambition truly lethal was his willingness to fast unto death repeatedly, using his own body as the ultimate weapon and forcing both the British and feuding Indians to negotiate rather than watch him die. His fasts weren't symbolic gestures but calculated political warfare—he'd announce he would die unless riots stopped or negotiations began, essentially holding his life hostage to achieve political ends, demonstrating that lethal ambition sometimes means threatening self-destruction to control others. When partition violence erupted in 1947, Gandhi's fasts stopped massacres that armies couldn't prevent, proving one man's moral authority could outweigh military force. His assassination by a Hindu nationalist who felt Gandhi favored Muslims tragically demonstrated that lethal ambition for peace makes enemies of extremists on all sides—yet his legacy of nonviolent resistance inspired King, Mandela, and countless others, proving that ideas pursued with absolute conviction can defeat empires without firing a shot, transforming powerlessness into power through the lethal ambition to suffer publicly for justice rather than compromise privately for survival.</p>
