                <p>Nikola Tesla embodied lethal ambition through his war against Thomas Edison's direct current system, betting everything on alternating current despite Edison's superior resources, ruthless business tactics, and public campaigns portraying AC as deadly—including electrocuting animals to terrify the public. Tesla's genius lay not just in inventing superior technology but in partnering with George Westinghouse to wage economic warfare, ultimately powering the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with AC current in a demonstration so spectacular it made Edison's DC system obsolete overnight. His lethal ambition manifested in pursuing visions decades ahead of available technology: wireless power transmission, radio communication, remote control, and renewable energy systems that seemed like fantasy in the 1890s but defined the 20th century, proving that true innovation requires seeing futures others can't imagine and refusing to compromise that vision for immediate profit.</p>

                <p>What made Tesla's ambition truly lethal was his tragic inability to balance genius with pragmatism, pursuing visions so pure they destroyed him financially while enriching others who stole his ideas. He tore up Westinghouse's royalty contract during a financial crisis, sacrificing millions to save his partner—demonstrating that lethal ambition can be self-destructive when divorced from self-interest. Tesla died alone and impoverished in a New York hotel, feeding pigeons while Marconi won Nobel Prizes for radio technology Tesla had invented, Edison became a billionaire, and the modern world ran on his AC current without paying him royalties. His tragedy proved that lethal ambition's dark side: being so far ahead you can't explain your visions to investors, so committed to revolutionary ideas you can't execute incremental profits, so focused on changing the world you forget to secure your own survival. Tesla's legacy demonstrates that lethal ambition without ruthless business acumen creates martyrs rather than moguls, visionaries who illuminate the future but die before its benefits arrive.</p>
