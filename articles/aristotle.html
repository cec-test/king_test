                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Aristotle's ambition was to systematize all human knowledge—logic, ethics, politics, metaphysics, biology, physics, poetry, rhetoric—and he largely succeeded. Student of Plato and tutor to Alexander the Great, Aristotle created the intellectual framework that dominated Western thought for over 2,000 years. His ambition was lethal in its intellectual scope: while Alexander conquered lands, Aristotle conquered knowledge itself, creating the categories and methods by which we still think today. He founded the Lyceum, history's first major research institution, and produced works on nearly every subject known to ancient Greece. His logic formed the basis of scientific reasoning, his ethics shaped moral philosophy, and his politics influenced governance from Rome to the Enlightenment.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">What made Aristotle's ambition truly lethal was his demonstration that ideas shape action—he tutored Alexander the Great, showing how philosophical ideas can literally shape world-conquering leaders. Where his teacher Plato dealt in ideals, Aristotle grounded philosophy in observable reality, creating empirical methods that birthed science itself. His "Nicomachean Ethics" defined virtue and excellence (arete) as skills developed through practice, not divine gifts—a revolutionary idea that made greatness achievable through discipline and ambition. Aristotle proved that lethal ambition in the intellectual realm means not just having ideas, but systematizing them so thoroughly that they become the foundation of civilization itself. His works were lost for centuries, yet when rediscovered in medieval Europe, they sparked the Renaissance. Aristotle showed that one mind, properly organized and relentlessly curious, can structure how humanity thinks for millennia.</p>
