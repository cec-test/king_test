                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Henry Ford's lethal ambition transformed automobiles from luxury toys into mass-market necessities by perfecting the assembly line manufacturing process that reduced Model T production time from 12 hours to 93 minutes, slashing prices so dramatically that his own workers could afford the cars they built. His revolutionary insight wasn't inventing the automobile—dozens of manufacturers preceded him—but recognizing that standardization and efficiency could create such massive volume that profits came from selling millions cheaply rather than thousands expensively, essentially democratizing transportation and transforming American society. Ford's famous declaration that customers could have any color "so long as it's black" revealed his philosophy: eliminate all customization, perfect one design, optimize every movement, and scale production until entire industries reorganize around your methods. His $5 daily wage—double the industry standard—wasn't generosity but calculated strategy: creating workers wealthy enough to buy cars while reducing turnover, proving that lethal ambition in business means rethinking entire industries rather than incrementally improving existing practices.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">What made Ford's ambition truly lethal was his authoritarian control over both factories and workers' lives, employing a "Sociology Department" that investigated employees' homes to ensure they lived according to Ford's values, firing those who drank, gambled, or lived in ways he deemed immoral. He violently suppressed union organizing, hired thugs to beat strikers, and created company towns where Ford controlled housing, stores, and social life—demonstrating that industrial efficiency required total control over human beings treated as interchangeable parts. His later years revealed darker ambitions: Ford published antisemitic propaganda in his newspaper "The Dearborn Independent," earning praise from Adolf Hitler and distributing "The International Jew" worldwide, proving that lethal ambition unconstrained by morality becomes monstrous. Ford's legacy demonstrates the duality of transformative innovation: his assembly lines liberated workers from agricultural poverty while subjugating them to industrial discipline, his manufacturing revolution democratized consumption while concentrating unprecedented power in corporate hands, and his business genius coexisted with vile prejudice, showing that lethal ambition to transform industry doesn't guarantee wisdom about humanity.</p>
