                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">Thomas Edison's lethal ambition manifested in his industrial approach to invention, creating history's first research laboratory at Menlo Park where teams of researchers systematically experimented toward commercial products rather than pursuing science for its own sake. His famous declaration "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration" revealed his philosophy: relentless experimentation would eventually yield results, leading him to test over 3,000 materials for light bulb filaments before finding one that worked commercially. Edison's genius wasn't just inventing the light bulb—others had created electric lights—but developing the entire electrical infrastructure system needed to make it profitable: generators, wiring, meters, and distribution networks, demonstrating that lethal ambition in innovation means controlling not just the invention but the entire ecosystem required for its adoption, transforming technical breakthroughs into monopolistic business empires.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 32px;">What made Edison's ambition truly lethal was his ruthless self-promotion and willingness to destroy competitors through any means necessary, most notoriously in his "War of Currents" against Tesla and Westinghouse. To discredit alternating current, Edison publicly electrocuted animals including an elephant named Topsy, sponsored development of the electric chair to associate AC with death, and spread propaganda that AC was deadly while his DC system was safe—losing the war but establishing his reputation for cutthroat business practices. He held over 1,000 patents yet many came from employees whose work he claimed, running his laboratory like a factory where researchers signed away invention rights, proving that lethal ambition sometimes means taking credit for others' genius while packaging it as your own. Edison's legacy demonstrates that transformative inventors need not be lone geniuses—they can be managers who industrialize innovation, turning the inventive process into systematic business operations, and who understand that history remembers whoever controls the narrative and patent office, not necessarily who had the original idea first.</p>
